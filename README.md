# DonationPal

## Introduction

DonationPal is a web application that helps users create and manage fund-raising campaigns to support various causes.

## Installation

1.  Install Node.js and npm: If you haven't already, download and install Node.js from the official website: Node.js Downloads. npm (Node Package Manager) is included with Node.js.

2.  Navigate to the Project Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you've cloned or downloaded the React project from GitHub.

3.  Install Dependencies: Run the following command to install project dependencies using npm:

            npm install

This command will read the package.json file in your project directory and install all the dependencies listed there. This includes React, React DOM, and any other libraries the project uses.

4.  Start the Development Server: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:

            npm start

5.  View the Project: After running npm start, you should see the React project running in your web browser at http://localhost:3000 by default. If not, the terminal output will provide you with the correct URL.
